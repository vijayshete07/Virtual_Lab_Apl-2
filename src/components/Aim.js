        <h1>Aim for Node.js Web Module</h1>
        <p>
        Hereâ€™s an expanded version of the aim with more details:

The aim of this program is to demonstrate the implementation of the Node.js web module by building a basic web server that handles HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate responses. Through this, students will learn how to manage different types of requests (such as GET and POST) and serve content dynamically. The program will also showcase the asynchronous, event-driven architecture of Node.js, which allows for non-blocking I/O operations, making it ideal for scalable and efficient web applications. Additionally, the use of external packages from Node Package Manager (NPM) will be demonstrated to further enhance functionality, such as adding middleware for request processing or serving static files. By the end of the program, students will gain a deeper understanding of how Node.js is utilized in modern web development.
